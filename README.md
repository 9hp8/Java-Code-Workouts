## Daily Routine

The objective is to engage in consistent practice by tackling at least one program daily. The exercises are categorized by difficulty, so you can start with simpler tasks and gradually move to more complex challenges.

### Suggested Routine

1. **Pick a category** from the appropriate folder (e.g., JavaBasics, DataStructuresAndAlgorithms, etc.).
2. **Select a problem** and try to solve it independently.
3. **Review the solution** after your attempt to understand alternative approaches.
4. **Explore related concepts** by reading through the OOPConcepts and Java8Features folders.
5. **Document your progress** by adding notes or comments to your code.

## Getting Started

To start practicing:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/9hp8/Java-Code-Workouts.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the desired folder** based on the topic or concept you wish to practice.
3. **Open the program file** in your preferred IDE and start coding!

## Contributing
